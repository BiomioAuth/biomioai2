  BIOMIO’s Gmail Extension is an example of how BIOMIO MFA platform can be used to ensure the receiving party’s identity.
	<br><br>
	          The goal of this extension is to encrypt the content of your email so that only you and the recipient can see it, and no-one else, whether the server is compromised, email is forwarded, or any number of other reasons.

				<p>When you send an email to someone else, you don’t expect it to be read by other people.  You expect it to be seen by the person receiving it only.</p>

		<strong>Here’s what we think happens when we send an email:</strong>

		The reality however is a lot more risk-prone than we imagine.  Your email server can be hacked.  The destination email server can be hacked.  Someone else could have access to the computer where your email is being read.  The receiver of your email can forward it to someone else.  Their email server can be hacked or expropriated.  Finally your email can be quoted by anyone for any reason.<br>

		<strong>Here’s what really happens:</strong>

		While a lot of email clients provide secure connection to the email server, that only addresses a small number of the vulnerabilities that your email is subjected to.
		With BIOMIO, the messages are encrypted not just for transport, but also for storage and are only decrypted for the eyes for which they were intended.

		<strong>What if I don’t use Gmail for my email?</strong><br><br>
		We are working on supporting other email clients, but for now you can most likely still make it work by using Gmail as your email client connecting to your current email server as a POP3 account.
