<li>Conduct research and analysis</li>
<li>Respond to your questions and concerns</li>
</ul><br>
<strong>Data Retention</strong><br><br>
The time periods for which we retain your Personal Information depend on the purposes for which we use it. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Services, unless we are required by law to dispose of it earlier or to keep it longer. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations and the legal obligations of Service Providers, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Please contact us as provided in the Notice section below if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the information we collect.<br><br>

<strong>Sharing of Personal Information Collected</strong>
<br><br>
BIOMIO does not sell, rent, or trade and, except as described in this Privacy Policy, does not share any Personal Information with third parties for their promotional purposes.<br><br>
BIOMIO may transmit or share Personal Information as follows:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>We may share Personal Information, with our authorized third party vendors, consultants, Service Providers and hosting partners who perform services for BIOMIO (including hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate, maintain and provide support related to the Services) based on BIOMIO’s instructions. These third parties may only use or disclose such Personal Information obtained from BIOMIO to perform the Services on BIOMIO’s behalf or comply with legal obligations.
</li>
<li>If you have an Organization account, we may also share Personal Information and/or Device-Specific Information with your Organization and/or your Organization’s third party vendors (with your employer’s consent) in order to operate and maintain the Services. Your device may be subject to your Organization’s policies and practices, which are separate from this Privacy Policy. We have no control over your Organization and your Organization’s third party vendors’ privacy practices. You are advised to read their applicable privacy policies. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and BIOMIO is not responsible for, use of your Personal Information by these other companies.
</li>

<li>We may also disclose Personal Information: (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (ii) to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (iii) as may be required for the purposes of national security; (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary and appropriate to prevent physical, mental, financial or other harm, injury or loss; or (v) in connection with an investigation of suspect or actual illegal or inappropriate activity or exposure to liability. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Service Terms and Conditions and any other agreements, or as otherwise required by law or to comply with any legal obligation.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
When we share Personal Information with a third party, they must contractually agree to comply with privacy and security standards at least as stringent as BIOMIO’s when it is handling similar data. When you provide data directly to the third party, the processing is based on their standards (which may or may not be the same as BIOMIO’s) and your own independent relationship with that provider.
<br><br>
By accessing, signing up for or using the Services, sending us email, or by signing up for email updates, you provide your express consent to our disclosure of your Personal Information to our third party service providers (such as credit card processors, managed hosting service providers, sub-processors of service data, and technology partners) in order to supply our Services. We do not permit our service providers to use your Personal Information for their own marketing purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the services they provide to us.
<br><br>
<strong>Cross-Border Transfer of Your Personal Information</strong>
<br><br>
Please be aware that BIOMIO may host and process your data and information (including Personal Information), in the United States and other countries through the BIOMIO group of companies and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Website and Services, including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). You may view the AWS privacy policy at http://aws.amazon.com/privacy. By signing up for or using the Services, and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Information in this way. Any such transfer or processing of your Personal Information will be in accordance with all applicable laws.
<br><br>
