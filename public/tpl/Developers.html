  <p>Web developers are often torn between doing social network based logins and offering their own identity management.  Trusting the social network login to do the authentication means taking on additional risk if the social network login is breached.  Biomio can provide an extra layer of security to supplement social network logins without causing a lot of inconvenience for the user.   Application publisher can decide what additional measures to ask for and vary those based on conditions such as location or device fingerprint.</p>
