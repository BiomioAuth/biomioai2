INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OWNERSHIP<br><br>
The Service is wholly owned by BIOMIO. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), Services, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (the “Materials”) provided by BIOMIO are protected by all relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws. All Materials contained in the Service are the property of BIOMIO or our third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by BIOMIO, you may not make use of the Materials. BIOMIO reserves all 
rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.<br><br>
Except as expressly set forth herein, BIOMIO alone (and its licensors, where applicable) will retain all Intellectual Property Rights relating to the Services or the Software or any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by Customer or any third party relating to the Services and/or the Software, which are hereby assigned to BIOMIO. Customer will not copy, distribute, reproduce or use any of the foregoing except as expressly permitted under this Agreement. As between the parties, BIOMIO owns all Performance Data. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to Customer any rights of ownership in or related to the Services or Software, or any Intellectual Property Rights.<br><br>
CONFIDENTIALITY<br><br>
The term “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”) in any form (written, oral, etc.) that is marked as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of the disclosure, including, without limitation: trade secrets; information relating to the Services; technology and technical information (intellectual property, inventions, know-how ideas and methods); business, financial and customer information (including Customer Data and Customer Personal Data); pricing, forecasts, strategies and product development plans; and/or the terms of this Agreement. Each party understands that the Disclosing Party has or may disclose Confidential Information in connection with this Agreement, but that Receiving Party shall receive no rights in, or licenses to, such Confidential Information. 
The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to disclose Confidential Information to any third person other than those of its employees, contractors, advisors, investors and potential acquirers (“Representatives”) with a need to have access thereto and who have entered into non-disclosure and non-use agreements applicable to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, and (ii) to use such Confidential Information solely as reasonably required in connection with the Services and/or this Agreement. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by any of its Representatives. The Receiving Party further agrees to take the same security precautions to protect against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized use of such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that the party takes with its own confidential or proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information. Each party acknowledges that the use of such precautions is not a guarantee against unauthorized disclosure or use. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party; or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party; or (d) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information as required in response to a request under applicable open records laws or pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice to contest such disclosure. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges that BIOMIO utilizes the services of certain third parties in connection with the provision of the Services (such as data hosting and telephony service providers) and such third parties will have access to Customer’s Confidential Information, subject to compliance with this Section 6. The parties agree that Performance Data is not Confidential Information and will not be subject to any confidentiality restrictions or obligations.<br> 
Each party agrees that, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly return to the Disclosing Party, or provide written certification of the destruction of, all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all Confidential Information contained in internal documents, without retaining any copy, extract or summary of any part thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party may retain copies of Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary for purposes of such party’s ordinary course internal document retention and backup requirements and procedures, provided that such Confidential Information shall 
remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for so long as it is retained.<br>
Customer acknowledges that BIOMIO does not wish to receive any Confidential Information from Customer that is not necessary for BIOMIO to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, unless the parties specifically agree otherwise, BIOMIO may reasonably presume that any unrelated information received from Customer is not confidential or Confidential Information, unless such information is marked as “Confidential.”<br><br>
